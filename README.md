# Doormats
Syrchalis has stepped away from the RimWorld modding scene, as such I am adopting the mod and will be maintaining it going forward.

Doormats - with a twist

## Main Feature
Adds leather and cloth doormats to prevent colonists from carrying filth into buildings. They are powerful at keeping filth in check but will will slow friendly, respectable folks down as they clean their feet while walking over them and as such will need to be cleaned regularly 

## Summary
Note: Cloth doormats need the "carpet making" research, leather doormats do not.

- Cleans pawn completely of any filth
- Only drops a single filth layer on the mat
- Very performance-friendly

- Doormats slow pawns down to simulate cleaning
	- Slowdown is configurable
	- Slowdown does not affect animals or enemies (so you cant use them as slow-zones)
	- Slowdown does not affect bleeding, drafted or fleeing pawns
	- Slowdown does also not affect doctors on the way to tending a patient or pawns carrying a pawn

Important: The slowdown does NOT affect pathfinding, meaning your colonists will **NOT** avoid them.

## Compatibility
Safe to add to existing game saves. Like most mods, remove at your own risk.

Incompatibilities:
None known
