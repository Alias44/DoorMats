# DoorMats
Alternative version of the doormat mod. The original version works by making pawns drop a single filth stack regularly if they are on a doormat. This version makes them drop a single stack too, but clears any other filth they might still have on them, so no matter how much filth they have on them it will be condensed into a single stack.

The result is that the doormats are far more powerful in keeping your base clean. Note that this is not necessarily balanced. However cost is also significantly increased (20 for small, 40 for big door mats).

Note: This version also force-spawns filth on the door mat, so putting it onto a non-accepting floor (like dirt or gravel) will not prevent it from getting dirty anymore.
